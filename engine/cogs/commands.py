Slash commands for interacting with the ghost directly:

- /seance <question>  - ask it something, get a cryptic in-character answer
- /haunt <user>        - it starts randomly slipping into that member's
                          conversations for a while
- /lore                - request the next unrevealed fragment of Velmora's
                          backstory
- /mood                - (admin-only) peek at the ghost's current mood
- /interact            - call out to another ghost bot for a brief,
                          capped public exchange (only when the character
                          config lists interact_partners)
